Arduino Automatic Night Light System

This project implements an automatic night light system using an Arduino microcontroller and a light dependent resistor (LDR) to detect ambient light levels. The system continuously monitors the surrounding environment and automatically controls an LED based on measured light intensity. When the environment becomes dark, the LED turns on, and when sufficient light is detected, the LED turns off.

The goal of this project was to design a simple embedded system that integrates sensor input, decision making logic, and output control while reinforcing fundamental concepts in microcontroller programming and analog signal processing. MATLAB was used to visualize and analyze the sensor data collected during operation in order to verify correct system behavior.

System Operation

The Arduino reads an analog voltage from the LDR using its onboard analog to digital converter. This value represents the ambient light level and is compared against a predefined threshold. If the measured value falls below the threshold, the system determines that the environment is dark and activates the LED. If the value exceeds the threshold, the LED is deactivated. This process runs continuously in a loop, allowing the system to respond in real time to changes in lighting conditions.

A flowchart was created to define and document the control logic used by the microcontroller. This flowchart outlines system initialization, sensor reading, threshold comparison, and LED control decisions.

MATLAB Data Analysis

MATLAB was used to process and visualize the sensor data generated by the Arduino. Several plots were created to analyze system behavior, including light sensor readings versus time, LED state versus time, and real time LDR response under changing light conditions. These visualizations confirm that the LED switches states correctly when the sensor value crosses the defined threshold and demonstrate consistent system performance.
